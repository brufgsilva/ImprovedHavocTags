Tired of looking for a Havoc at the party finder and asking yourself
“Is this modifier Red, Purple or Orange?
“Is Rampaging Enemies the red one???”
Yeah, me too.
 
This mod offers a simple localization tweak and recolour of specific Havoc modifiers to match their corresponding buff colors, making them easier to identify at a glance in Party Finder.
 
The tags will be displayed like this in Party Finder (see Images):
RampagingEnemies
The Encroaching Garden
Heinous Rituals
*Enraging Elites (previously The Final Toll -read below-)
 
*The only name change is “The Final Toll” which I renamed to “Enraging Elites”. In the source code, it's labeled as “mutator_havoc_enraged” and it applies to Elites…so the new name reflects that more clearly.
 
This mod only defines tags in English, Russian and Simplified Chinese!

Translations made by:
- xsSplater (RU localization)
- AtGeO (Simplified Chinese localization)

If you want to include any translation feel free to contact me through here or in the Darktide Modders Discord thread and I will merge it to the main mod.

If you’re familiar with modding, feel free to open the main .lua file and customize the text to your language or preference for personal use. If you have any ideas for this mod, please leave it in the comments and I might include it. Thanks! :)
